# PiG

Interpreter for very simple language. The grammar is defined as follows:

a  ::= x | n | a opa a | ( a )

opa ::= + | - | * | / | ^

S  ::= x = a | S1; S2 | while b do S done

## Execute  

* Run `stack exec -- PiG-exe` to start interpreter
* With `stack exec -- PiG-exe --verbose` you will see the same message, with more logging.
